Range Extraction https://www.codewars.com/kata/range-extraction
```
A format for expressing an ordered list of integers is to use a comma separated list of either

- individual integers
- or a range of integers denoted by the starting integer separated from the end integer in the range by a dash, '-'. The range includes all integers in the interval including both endpoints. It is not considered a range unless it spans at least 3 numbers. For example "12,13,15-17"
Complete the solution so that it takes a list of integers in increasing order and returns a correctly formatted string in the range format.

Example:
Solution.rangeExtraction(new int[] {-10, -9, -8, -6, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20})
# returns "-10--8,-6,-3-1,3-5,7-11,14,15,17-20"

```
